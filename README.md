# CCI Programs

This is a set of programs written for the [Cedar Creek Institute](http://www.cedarcreekinst.org).  They encompass  these programs: FileConverter converts and processes a BDF format file to another BDF file or to an internal format called FILMAN; StatusScan analyzes the conversion process itself; FMGraph2 displays multichannel FILMAN data files; ASCtoFMConverter converts BDF files to FILMAN files using a different technique than FileConverter; and CreateBDFFile creates artificial BDF files.
